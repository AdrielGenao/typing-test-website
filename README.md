# typing-test-website
Utilizes Flask and Javascript to create a typing test website ([adrielgenao2.pythonaywhere.com](https://adrielgenao2.pythonanywhere.com)), similar to TypingTest.py. Uses a system of editing "span" elements within HTML/Javascript to create the correct and incorrect typed letters within the test. Displays your accuracy and speed at the end of the test, and displays current WPM at top of the page. There are also options for 60 second and 30 second tests, as well as a button to change the current test. The site also has a system of accounts for storing top speeds, and a leaderboard for each logged page to have users compete with their top speeds.
Note - If link leads to page from PythonAnywhere saying the website is down/not functioning, just reload the page a couple of times to go the home page/site.
